I used create react app for project, to persist results from questions and answers i used a simple db using json-server, which is locacted in the api folder.  you can submit answers as many times as you like but results only shows last submission.  to start up json-server you have to run npm start for api folder as well as npm start for client folder.  PLease contact me if you have any more questions.
